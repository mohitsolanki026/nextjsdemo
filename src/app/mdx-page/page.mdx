import Welcome from "./Welcome.mdx";

<div className="mx-10"> 
I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

# Welcome to my MDX page!

This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Checkout my React component:

hello how are you  
ashish
JS Variable: `let x = 1`

```js
const x = 3;
let y = 4;
```

<Welcome />
</div>
export default ({children}) => <div  className = 'prose max-w-none'> {children} </div>
